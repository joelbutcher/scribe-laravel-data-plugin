## #YOLO JUST SUBMIT A PR

A great idea taken from https://github.com/metabase/metabase/blob/master/docs/contributing.md#yolo-just-submit-a-pr.

If you come up with something really cool, and want to share it with us, just submit a PR. If it hasn't gone through the above process, we probably won't merge it as is, but if it's compelling, we're more than willing to help you via code review, design review and generally OCD nitpicking so that it fits into the rest of our codebase.
